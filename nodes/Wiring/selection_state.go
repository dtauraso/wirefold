// selection_state.go — selectionState groups the CURRENTLY-SELECTED (click-select) and
// CURRENTLY-HOVERED (pointer hover) fields, pure UI state parked on the routing directory
// (MoveDispatch). It is owned as a field by MoveDispatch (md.sel); there is no goroutine —
// the gesture FSM mutates it directly, serialized by the single-goroutine stdin reader.

// selectionState carries the current click-selection and pointer-hover state.
type selectionState struct {
	// selected is the CURRENTLY-SELECTED node id (click-select), owned by Go. "" = nothing
	// selected. Set by the gesture FSM's click outcome (applySelect) and emitted via
	// KindSelect so the buffer snapshot marks the node's Selected column.
	selected string
	// selectedEdge is the CURRENTLY-SELECTED edge label (click-select), owned by Go. "" =
	// no edge selected. Set by the gesture FSM's click outcome (applySelect) and emitted via
	// KindSelect (Edge field) so the buffer snapshot marks the edge's Selected column.
	// Exclusive with `selected`: selecting an edge clears the node selection and vice versa.

	// hoverNode / hoverPort / hoverInput are the CURRENTLY-HOVERED entity (pointer hover),
	// owned by Go. The gesture FSM tracks them from the raycast hit on each pointer-move and
	// emits KindHover ONLY when they change (dedupe) so pointer-move doesn't flood the
	// snapshot. hoverPort != "" means a port is hovered (on hoverNode); otherwise hoverNode
	// (possibly "") is the hovered node. "" / "" = nothing hovered.
